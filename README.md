  ```objc
  _popupController = [[zhPopupController alloc] initWithView:customView size:alert.bounds.size];
  _popupController.presentationStyle = zhPopupSlideStyleTransform;
  _popupController.presentationTransformScale = 1.25;
  _popupController.dismissonTransformScale = 0.85;

- Support following keyboard popup and hide

  If you want to make the animation consistent: 

  You need to call the method "becomeFirstResponder()" in "willPresentBlock", don't call it before that.

  You need to call the method "resignFirstResponder()" in "willDismissBlock".

  ```objc
  /// default is NO. if YES, Will adjust view position when keyboard changes
  @property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL keyboardChangeFollowed;
  
  /// default is NO. if the view becomes first responder，you need set YES to keep the animation consistent
  @property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL becomeFirstResponded;
  ```
  
  ```objc
  _popupController.becomeFirstResponded = YES;
  _popupController.keyboardChangeFollowed = YES;
  _popupController.willPresentBlock = ^(zhPopupController * _Nonnull popupController) {
  	[textField becomeFirstResponder];
  };
          
  _popupController.willDismissBlock = ^(zhPopupController * _Nonnull popupController) {
  	[textField resignFirstResponder];
  };
